## dotfiles

missing stuff: 
* rofi configs
* actually finishing xmonad keybindings
* migrating everything if possible to nix expressions
* Taffybar is a bit buggy. Sometimes it doesn't work on multiple monitors
* Alacritty/xmonad/vscode sometimes get stuck in ABYSMAL input delay. Sometimes the solution is to close the window, other times only logging out of xmonad altogether works...
